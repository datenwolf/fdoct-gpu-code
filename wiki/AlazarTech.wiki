#labels AlazarTech
The AlazarTech Program is compatible with data acquisition using the AlazarTech digitizer cards (Pointe-Claire, Qu√©bec).

Introduction
We used AlazarTech for Swept Source OCT, where the wavelength-to-wavenumber interpolation and numerical dispersion compesnation was excluded.

Details
The thread library used is a very light-weight thread library we found online. Otherwise, only CUDA installation is required for this program to operate, which can be foudn on the NVIDIA website for CUDA developpers.

This code is for CUDA 4.2, and may not be compatible with older or newer versions of CUDA
